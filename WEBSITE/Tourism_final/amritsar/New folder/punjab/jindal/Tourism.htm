		<p align="justify"><b>J</b>alandhar is believed to have emerged out of the sea.  This legendary origin of Jalandhar is confirmed by some geologists who believe that once upon a time the  sea stretched up to Jalandhar Doab and the neighbouring  Shiwaliks of Hoshiarpur.   According  to the Padma Purana, the City takes its name  from the great "Daitya" King , Jalandhra, the son of the Ocean.</p>

		<p align="justify">The  earliest  historical mention of Jalandhar occurs in the reign  of Kanishka, when  about  A.D.  100 a council of Buddhist  Theologions  met  near Jalandhar  chiefly  for  the purpose of collecting manuscripts  and  preparing commentaries on them.</p>

		<p align="justify">Jalandhar  gave rise to the Nath Movement between the eighth and tenth century A.D.    At  the  site  where  the   samadh  of  one  of  the  foremost representatives of the movements Jogi Jalandhar Nath once stood, was built the exiting shrine of Imam Nasir-ud-din Chishti in the fifteenth century.</p>

		<p align="justify">Jalandhar  was  when  visited  by  Hiuen   Tsang  the  capital  of   a considerable  State  ruled over by Katoch chiefs, the town itself  being  more than three  kilometers  in  circuit, It was taken by Ibrahim Sah of  Ghor,  in A.D., 1179-80  and  was  a place of considerable importance  in  the  struggle between Jasrath Khokar and the Muhammedan governors in 1422-42.</p>

		<p align="justify">Under  the  Mughal Emperors, Jalandhar was always the capital  of  the northern  and most important portion of the Jalandhar Doab which then extended to the neighbourhood of Multan, in fact of the whole of the Doab, as it is now constituted.  The last Mohammedan governor was Adina Beg, whose intrigues with the Sikhs  and Marathas have already been noticed. Governer  Adina  Beg   died in 1758,  having  in  the  previous year allowed Guru  Badbhag  Singh  of Kartarpur,  to burn Jalandhar in revenge for the destruction of  Katarpur  by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1756.</p>

		<p align="justify">In  A.D.   1766 Jalandhar fell into the hands of the Sikh Misal of the Faizullapuria,  then  under Khushal Singh.  His son Budh Singh, who  succeeded him as head  of the Misl, built a masonry fort in the city, the site of  which is now occupied  by the Killa Mohalla while several of the other leaders built forts of  unburnt  bricks.  In 1811, Diwan Mohkam Chand was sent  by  Maharaja Ranjit Singh  to annex the Faizullapuria possession in the Jalandhar Doab  and Sardar Budh  singh  fled to his protected possession across the  Satluj.   His troops put  some  resistance, but gave up in Jalandhar in October.  From  this time , it  was  the  capital  of the possessions of the Lahore  State in  the Jalandhur Doab until annexation to the British dominions after the First Anglo Sikh War ,1845-46.  It then became the headquarters of the Commissionership of the Trans-Satluj States, afterwards known as the Commissionership of Jalandhur.</p>

		<p align="justify"><img src="./Tourism_files/imam_nasar.jpg" alt="Imam Nasir" width="150" height="200" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">Jalandhar boasts of many historic monuments. Prominent among them are the mausoleum of Imam Nasir, the fort at Phillaur which once served as Maharaja Ranjit Singh's line of defence against the British, a Shiv Mandir which dates back to the Lodhi era, Devi Talab Mandir, Tombs at Nakodar, Sarai at Nurmahal, Gurudwara at Kartarpur etc.</p>
